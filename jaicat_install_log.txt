INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of instapy to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Cannot install instapy==0.6.16 and jsonschema==4.18.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested jsonschema==4.18.0
    instapy 0.6.16 depends on jsonschema<3 and >=2.6.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
